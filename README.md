**Hello!** ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my NixOS configurations! Using the new funny flakes, and is constantly changing, perhaps sometimes for the worse, but hopefully for the working.

Heavily based off of [thise](https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles) NixOS config, the base structure is the same, except I've made some modifications to better suit my needs. 

One of the bigger requirements I have with my config is supporting multiple hosts, each with their own architecture and nixpkgs version. Feel free to take a look at my `flake.nix` and the `lib` folder to see if you want something like this too!

I expose some helpful things via flakes, probably the most useful would be some of my packages in `./packages/`, those are accessible as you'd expect, via `my-flake.packages."${system}.name` in case you'd ever want to use any of them! I try to upstream most of my packages to Nixpkgs, so you'll probably be able to find them there anyway.
